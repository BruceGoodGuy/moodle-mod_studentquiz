    And I import "Course 1" course into "Course 2" course using this options:
    Then I should see "studentquiz 0"
    # Todo default category seems not ready yet, tried fixing using
    # locallib.php mod_studentquiz_add_default_question_category()
    # but this is not the right approach yet
    #And I follow "studentquiz 0"
    #And I should see "Create new question"
    #And I click on "Start Quiz" "button"
    #And I should see "Attempt quiz now"
